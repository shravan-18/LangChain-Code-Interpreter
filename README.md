A Code Interpreter application built using LangChain.

This repository houses a Python-Code-Interpreter project I created using the LangChain framework. It provides the capability to request the app to generate QR Codes pointing to an address, or add a .csv file and ask questions from it. I am working on adding new features to this application.
